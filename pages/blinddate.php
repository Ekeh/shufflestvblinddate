    <p>To go on a blind date on the Show,</p>
    <ol>
    <li>When you register and click on the menu bar, you will see a link "Update Profile". Click it. It will bring up a form.</li>
                        <li>Fill the form and select a picture (you can change it as often as you wish) and submit.</li>
                        <li>Your uploaded picture goes to the general gallery where you will see many other pics. Scroll gently through to confirm you see your own picture.</li>
                        <li>To send a date request, click on the picture of who you may want to go on the Blind Date with and scroll down. You will see "Send Date Request". Click it.</li>
                        <li>To see if you have any date requests, click the "View Date Requests' on the menu.</li>
                        <li>When they accept your date request you sent out or you receive a date request and accept, you match.</li>
                        <li>You can check/confirm whether you are truly matched by clicking the "Unmatch" button on the menu bar. If you accepted the date request in error or may have changed your mind about your date, click the "unmatch" button at the end of the row.</li>
                        <li>If you match, & we interview you and find out you or your pair dont match for what we think may make for good reality TV, we will un match you so you can try next time with someone else.</li>
                        <li>Because we may get more matches than we may probably be able to interview for the episodes we may be shooting, if you match and we have not interviewed you, you may stay matched with your pair till we do. Or unmatch on your own when/if you see another person to shoot at.</li>
                        <li>For the period you remain matched, you wont be able to send or receive date requests. To un match, click the "unmatch" link on menu.</li>
                        <li><b>Look well before you send or accept a date request.</b></li>
                        <li>The system is also designed to prevent against "abuse" and you may have to pay a small "fine" to be able to continue to use the website if it detects you are being too careless with sending or accepting or matching & unmatching.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Shoot or Get Shot At !</p>
